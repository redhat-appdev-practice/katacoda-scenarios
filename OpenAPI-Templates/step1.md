OpenAPI Generator has been designed to allow for the easy extension or even creation of a NEW generator. This lab will take a look at modifying the existing templates for OpenAPI in order to extend the functionality.

### External resources
Note that while this class will take a look at updating existing templates, there is a lot more that can be done with customization that can be found [here](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/templating). Also while no previous knowledge of OpenAPI's templating language [mustache](https://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html) is required, it is recommend you take a couple minutes to familiarize yourself with some of the basics.
