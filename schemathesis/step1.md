An open source project used to generate applications based on OpenAPI v2.0/v3.0 Documents. With support for over 40 different languages it can be used to create both the client and server applications based on the same OAS file, helping to prevent any drift between your API specification and your code. OpenAPI Generator is even able to generate html documentation based on your OAS.

The practice of having a clearly defined API at the outset of a project. An important aspect of contract first development is an agreement with your team that any updates to the contract happen *before* any updates to the code.
